- **Microservices:** The system is built as a set of loosely coupled microservices, each responsible for specific functionalities, enabling scalability and flexibility.

- **Saga Patterns:** Sagas are used to manage distributed transactions and long-running processes across microservices.

- **Outbox Patterns:** To ensure event-driven consistency, the outbox pattern is employed to publish events reliably.

- **Hexagonal Architecture:** The system follows a hexagonal (ports and adapters) architecture, separating core business logic from external concerns.

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Patterns:** DDD principles are applied to model the domain effectively, ensuring that the codebase reflects real-world business processes.
